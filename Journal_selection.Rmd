```{r}
journaldata <- read.csv("./Data/ecoconpapers.csv", header = TRUE)
head(journaldata)
```

let's ee the unique journal names...
```{r}
journaldata$Journal <- as.character(journaldata$Journal)
journals <- unique(journaldata$Journal)
journals
```
ok a few duplicates here to merge....
```{r}
journaldata$Journal <- replace(journaldata$Journal, journaldata$Journal == "PLOS ONE", "PLoS ONE")
journaldata$Journal <- replace(journaldata$Journal, journaldata$Journal == "Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science", "ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE")
journaldata$Journal <- replace(journaldata$Journal, journaldata$Journal == "ESTUARIES AND COASTS", "Estuaries and Coasts")
journaldata$Journal <- replace(journaldata$Journal, journaldata$Journal == "Estuarine, coastal and shelf science", "ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE")
journals <- unique(journaldata$Journal)
journals
```
ok now do a table of the frequency of each publication
```{r}
library(plyr) #need this package to run 'count'
journalfreq <- count(journaldata, 'Journal') 
journalfreq <- journalfreq[order(-journalfreq$freq), ] #this reorders in frequency descending order (note the -)
journalfreq
```
ok let's export that table...

```{r}
write.csv(journalfreq, file = "./Data/journalspaperscamefrom.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```
